The processed.fasta files can be found in /molmicro/working/sara/capture_pipeline_output/180117run411human/ (barcodes 32-36, 0-10000 copies/organism diluted into human DNA, sheared to 150bp) and /molmicro/working/sara/capture_pipeline_output/180522_run483MC_output/ (barcodes 25-29, 0-10000 copies/organism diluted into human DNA, sheared to 400bp).

Each of the starting samples was 100ng total (human + mock community DNA, both sheared to either 150bp or 400bp).  The mock community DNA was added as follows:

/molmicro/working/sara/capture_pipeline_output/180117run411human/

411-32, 0 copies/organism (150bp)
411-33, 10 copies/organism (150bp)
411-34, 100 copies/organism (150bp)
411-35, 1000 copies/organism (150bp)
411-36, 10000 copies/organism (150bp)

/molmicro/working/sara/capture_pipeline_output/180522_run483MC_output/

483-25, 0 copies/organism (400bp)
483-26, 10 copies/organism (400bp)
483-27, 100 copies/organism (400bp)
483-28, 1000 copies/organism (400bp)
483-29, 10000 copies/organism (400bp)
